## GPT Prompt / recap of my work too 

Prompt: Hello, im a self taught programmer who did some Python, some Bash and a little of WSL2. I use a windows 11 and i have downloaded the Clion IDE from jetbrain. I am following the "C Programming_a Modern Approach (2nd ed.)" by K.N. King book to learn about C from the ground up. 

I want you to act as a teacher that explain me things in simple and to the point sentences.

I have opened a project using Clion and set up the C compiler to C99 and i haven't done anything else.

I am at the end of chapter 6, for now I have seen:
- C basic syntax
- No library except `#include <stdio.h>`
- `printf` & `scanf` + conversion specifications & escape sequences
- The basic C operators : Arithmetic, Assignment,
- The Selection statements `if, if-else, switch` + Relational operators & Logical operators
    - The conditional operator &xrarr; `condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;`
- The C99 Boolean introduction &xrarr; `#include <stdbool.h>`
- Loops &xrarr; `while, do, for` statements + loop jumps `break, continue, goto`
